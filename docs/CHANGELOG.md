## v1.24.0 (21 Dec 2021)

**Changes**:

- Align method names with convention, where ts-sql-query tries to use well known method names, giving preferences to already existing names in JavaScript, o well known function names in SQL, avoiding abbreviations. Methods with new names (Previous names are still available as deprecated methods):

    | Previous name              | New name           |
    | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
    | `smaller`                  | `lessThan`         |

## v1.1.0 (9 Mar 2021) 

**Changes:**

- Implements SQL with clause that allows using a select as a view in another select query.
- Rework insensitive comparison to allow use collations instead of the lower function; allowing in that way make comparison case insensitive and accent insensitive.
- Implements insensitive order by extension.
- Rework boolean management to support databases that don't have boolean data type (Sql Server and Oracle).
- Add support to custom boolean columns.
- Add support to execute better-sqlite3 queries synchronously.

- Fix some 'not' ignored during text comparison: notContainsInsensitive (on MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, SqlServer), notEndWith (on Oracle, Sqlite, SqlServer)
- Fix some posible invalid order by in MySql, MariaDB, SqlServer and Sqlite.
- Fix invalid queries involving boolean operations in Sql Server and Oracle.
- Fix missing bigint cast for a value coming from the database when it is a number.

## v1.0.0 (30 Jan 2021)

First stable release!

See [1.0.0-beta.1 release notes](#v1.0.0-beta.1)

**Bug fixes:**

- `setIfValue`, `setIfSetIfValue`, `setIfNotSetIfValue` when insert or update now have the same behaviour that any `*IfValue` function, respecting the configuration about treating an empty string as null value

## v1.0.0-beta.1 (29 Dec 2020)

**Changes:**

- Implements reusable fragments as functions using the `buildFragmentWithArgs` function with the `arg` and `valueArg` functions (all defined in the connection)
- Implements reusable fragments as functions that allow creating `*IfValue` functions using the `buildFragmentWithArgsIfValue` function with the `arg` and `valueArg` functions (all defined in the connection)
- Add support to the newest Better Sqlite 3 returning bingint
- Update all dependencies, and apply all required changes
- Implements the method `execute` in the query runners to allows have direct access to the database using the raw objects used to establish the connection
- Refactor how const values are handled. Now value source included two new methods:
    - `isConstValue(): boolean` that allows verify if it contains a const value
    - `getConstValue(): TYPE` that allows getting the value of a const value source (throw an error if it is not a const value source)
- Update the readme to include explanations about dynamic queries
- Add support to `bigint` column type
- Add examples section to the readme

**Braking changes:**

- Don't inline true or false values when they are defined with the const function. If you want a true or false value inlined use the `true()` and `false()` methods defined in the connection
- Rename `QueryRunner.getNativeConnection` as `getNativeRunner` to avoid confusion because this method doesn't return the connection in all the implementation (could be the pool)
- Big refactor to reduce the pressure on TypeScript type validations. **Breaking changes**:
    - Connections classes now only receive one generic argument with a unique name.
        - **Before**: `DBConnection extends PostgreSqlConnection<DBConnection, 'DBConnection'> { }`
        - **After**: `DBConnection extends PostgreSqlConnection<'DBConnection'> { }`
    - Tables and views now receive a second generic argument with a unique name.
        - **Before**: `class TCompany extends Table<DBConnection> { ... }`
        - **After**: `class TCompany extends Table<DBConnection, 'TCompany'> { ... }`
        - **Before**: `class VCustomerAndCompany extends View<DBConnection> { ... }`
        - **After**: `class VCustomerAndCompany extends View<DBConnection, 'VCustomerAndCompany'> { ... }`
- The value argument and the return type in the type adapters (including the default implementation in the connection) have now type `unknown`
- Trak if a value source is optional and validates if the result of executing a query return a value when it is expected. **Braking changes**:
    - A const with an optional value must be created using the new `optionalConst` function in the connection, previously was used the `const` function in the connection
    - The`is` function that allows comparing two values now returns a not optional boolean, previously it returned an optional value
- Dropped the method `NumberValueSource.asStringNumber`, use instead the new methods:
    - `NumberValueSource.asInt(): number`
    - `NumberValueSource.asDouble(): number`
    - `NumberValueSource.asStringInt(): number|string`
    - `NumberValueSource.asStringDouble(): number|string`
    - `StringNumberValueSource.asStringInt(): number|string`
    - `StringNumberValueSource.asStringDouble(): number|string`

**Internal changes:**

- Big refactor without change the public interface:
    - Use symbols for type marks instead of protected  fields
    - Use interfaces instead of abstract classes (allowed by the previous change)
    - Use import type when it is possible
    - Join all databases files in one file
    - Drop alternative implementations code not in use

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix invalid query when no value is provided to the function `concatIfValue`
- Fix invalid usage of `*IfValue` functions result, now typescript report an error when it happens
- Handle when the update has nothing to set, in that case, no update will be performed, and it returns 0 rows updated
