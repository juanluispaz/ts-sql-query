- Add support to custom array types
- Add support to globally encrypted id
- Big refactor to simplify the query runners implementation
- Dropped support to very old better-sqlite3 versions (6 or before)
- Allow to use returning clause on sqlite and mariadb in a sql text query executed directly with the query runner

- Implements compound operator (`union`, `intersect`, `except`) on select expressions.
- Allows `executeSelectPage` on select with `group by`
- Allows insert from select returning last inserted id in PostgreSql and Sql Server
- Extends the possibility of a select query to change the shape of the projected object allowing move some property to an internal object (split) or combine the result with a second query string the value as a property of the first one (compose)
- Add support to recursive select queries

**Bug fixes**:

- Fix `startsWith` and `endsWith` misspelling

## v1.3.0 (9 May 2021)

**Changes**:

- Add the transaction method to the connection to make easier deal with transactions at high level
- Add Prisma support

**New examples**:

- Add MariaDB example using prisma for the connection
- Add MySql example using prisma for the connection
- Add PostgreSql example using prisma for the connection
- Add Sqlite example using prisma for the connection
- Add SqlServer example using prisma for the connection

## v1.2.0 (3 May 2021)

**Changes**:

- Implements LoggingQueryRunner

**Documentation changes**:

- README improvements
- Include optionalConst connection method in the documentation

## v1.1.0 (9 Mar 2021) 

**Changes:**

- Implements SQL with clause that allows using a select as a view in another select query.
- Rework insensitive comparison to allow use collations instead of the lower function; allowing in that way make comparison case insensitive and accent insensitive.
- Implements insensitive order by extension.
- Rework boolean management to support databases that don't have boolean data type (Sql Server and Oracle).
- Add support to custom boolean columns.
- Add support to execute better-sqlite3 queries synchronously.
- Add support to computed columns on tables.
- Add ID encrypter utility.

**Documentation changes:**

- Add PostgreSql example using pg for the connection and encrypted primary/foreign keys.

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix mismatching column name when an uppercase character is used as column's alias on PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL lowercase the column's alias when it is not escaped; in consequence, an error was thrown because the column was not found.
- Fix some 'not' ignored during text comparison: notContainsInsensitive (on MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, SqlServer), notEndWith (on Oracle, Sqlite, SqlServer)
- Fix some posible invalid order by in MySql, MariaDB, SqlServer and Sqlite.
- Fix invalid queries involving boolean operations in Sql Server and Oracle.
- Fix missing bigint cast for a value coming from the database when it is a number.

## v1.0.0 (30 Jan 2021)

First stable release!

See [1.0.0-beta.1 release notes](#v1.0.0-beta.1)

**Bug fixes:**

- `setIfValue`, `setIfSetIfValue`, `setIfNotSetIfValue` when insert or update now have the same behaviour that any `*IfValue` function, respecting the configuration about treating an empty string as null value

## v1.0.0-beta.1 (29 Dec 2020)

**Changes:**

- Implements reusable fragments as functions using the `buildFragmentWithArgs` function with the `arg` and `valueArg` functions (all defined in the connection)
- Implements reusable fragments as functions that allow creating `*IfValue` functions using the `buildFragmentWithArgsIfValue` function with the `arg` and `valueArg` functions (all defined in the connection)
- Add support to the newest Better Sqlite 3 returning bingint
- Update all dependencies, and apply all required changes
- Implements the method `execute` in the query runners to allows have direct access to the database using the raw objects used to establish the connection
- Refactor how const values are handled. Now value source included two new methods:
    - `isConstValue(): boolean` that allows verify if it contains a const value
    - `getConstValue(): TYPE` that allows getting the value of a const value source (throw an error if it is not a const value source)
- Update the readme to include explanations about dynamic queries
- Add support to `bigint` column type
- Add examples section to the readme

**Braking changes:**

- Don't inline true or false values when they are defined with the const function. If you want a true or false value inlined use the `true()` and `false()` methods defined in the connection
- Rename `QueryRunner.getNativeConnection` as `getNativeRunner` to avoid confusion because this method doesn't return the connection in all the implementation (could be the pool)
- Big refactor to reduce the pressure on TypeScript type validations. **Breaking changes**:
    - Connections classes now only receive one generic argument with a unique name.
        - **Before**: `DBConection extends PostgreSqlConnection<DBConection, 'DBConnection'> { }`
        - **After**: `DBConection extends PostgreSqlConnection<'DBConnection'> { }`
    - Tables and views now receive a second generic argument with a unique name.
        - **Before**: `class TCompany extends Table<DBConection> { ... }`
        - **After**: `class TCompany extends Table<DBConection, 'TCompany'> { ... }`
        - **Before**: `class VCustomerAndCompany extends View<DBConection> { ... }`
        - **After**: `class VCustomerAndCompany extends View<DBConection, 'VCustomerAndCompany'> { ... }`
- The value argument and the return type in the type adapters (including the default implementation in the connection) have now type `unknown`
- Trak if a value source is optional and validates if the result of executing a query return a value when it is expected. **Braking changes**:
    - A const with an optional value must be created using the new `optionalConst` function in the connection, previously was used the `const` function in the connection
    - The`is` function that allows comparing two values now returns a not optional boolean, previously it returned an optional value
- Dropped the method `NumberValueSource.asStringNumber`, use instead the new methods:
    - `NumberValueSource.asInt(): number`
    - `NumberValueSource.asDouble(): number`
    - `NumberValueSource.asStringInt(): number|string`
    - `NumberValueSource.asStringDouble(): number|string`
    - `StringNumberValueSource.asStringInt(): number|string`
    - `StringNumberValueSource.asStringDouble(): number|string`

**Internal changes:**

- Big refactor without change the public interface:
    - Use symbols for type marks instead of protected  fields
    - Use interfaces instead of abstract classes (allowed by the previous change)
    - Use import type when it is possible
    - Join all databases files in one file
    - Drop alternative implementations code not in use

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix invalid query when no value is provided to the function `concatIfValue`
- Fix invalid usage of `*IfValue` functions result, now typescript report an error when it happens
- Handle when the update has nothing to set, in that case, no update will be performed, and it returns 0 rows updated
