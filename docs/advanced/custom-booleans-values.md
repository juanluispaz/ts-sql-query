# Custom booleans values

Sometimes, especially when working with [Oracle](../configuration/supported-databases/oracle.md) databases, booleans are stored using custom values rather than standard `true` and `false`. For instance, a field might use the character `'Y'` to represent `true` and `'N'` to represent `false`.

For example:

```ts
import { Table } from "ts-sql-query/Table";
import { CustomBooleanTypeAdapter } from "ts-sql-query/TypeAdapter";

const tCustomCompany = new class TCustomCompany extends Table<DBConnection, 'TCustomCompany'> {
    id = this.autogeneratedPrimaryKey('id', 'int');
    name = this.column('name', 'string');
    isBig = this.column('is_big', 'boolean', new CustomBooleanTypeAdapter('Y', 'N'));
    constructor() {
        super('custom_company'); // table name in the database
    }
}();
```

The table `custom_company` the field `is_big` accepts the values `Y` and `N`. This field represents a boolean type, and on the JavaScript side, it will be mapped as boolean. But, on the database side, the field will be treated with appropriated values. The conversion between values will be performed by `ts-sql-query` automatically; you don't need to be worried about the type mismatching even if you try to assign the value to another field with a different way of representing booleans.

You can perform an insert in this way:

```ts
const insertCustomCompany = connection.insertInto(tCustomCompany).set({
        name: 'My Big Company',
        isBig: true
    }).returningLastInsertedId()
    .executeInsert();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    insert into custom_company (name, is_big) 
    values (?, case when ? then 'Y' else 'N' end) 
    returning id
    ```
=== "MySQL"
    ```mysql
    insert into custom_company (`name`, is_big) 
    values (?, case when ? then 'Y' else 'N' end)
    -- Last inserted ID returned by the database got from the connection
    ```
=== "Oracle"
    ```oracle
    insert into custom_company (name, is_big) 
    values (:0, case when (:1 = 1) then 'Y' else 'N' end) 
    returning id 
    into :2
    ```
===+ "PostgreSQL"
    ```postgresql
    insert into custom_company (name, is_big) 
    values ($1, case when $2::bool then 'Y' else 'N' end) 
    returning id
    ```
=== "SQLite"
    ```sqlite
    insert into custom_company (name, is_big) 
    values (?, case when ? then 'Y' else 'N' end) 
    returning id
    ```
=== "SQL Server"
    ```sqlserver
    insert into custom_company (name, is_big) 
    output inserted.id 
    values (@0, case when (@1 = 1) then 'Y' else 'N' end)
    ```

The parameters are: `[ 'My Big Company', true ]` (On [Oracle](../configuration/supported-databases/oracle.md), output parameters are added at the corresponding position with the structure `{dir:3003}`)

The result type is:

```tsx
const insertCustomCompany: Promise<number>
```

Or a select:

```ts
const selectAllBigCompanies = connection.selectFrom(tCustomCompany)
    .where(tCustomCompany.isBig)
    .select({
        id: tCustomCompany.id,
        name: tCustomCompany.name,
        isBig: tCustomCompany.isBig
    }).executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        id as id, 
        name as name, 
        (is_big = 'Y') as isBig 
    from custom_company 
    where is_big = 'Y'
    ```
=== "MySQL"
    ```mysql
    select 
        id as id, 
        `name` as `name`, 
        (is_big = 'Y') as isBig 
    from custom_company 
    where is_big = 'Y'
    ```
=== "Oracle"
    ```oracle
    select 
        id as "id", 
        name as "name", 
        case when is_big = 'Y' then 1 else 0 end as "isBig" 
    from custom_company 
    where (is_big = 'Y')
    ```
===+ "PostgreSQL"
    ```postgresql
    select 
        id as id, 
        name as name, 
        (is_big = 'Y') as "isBig" 
    from custom_company 
    where is_big = 'Y'
    ```
=== "SQLite"
    ```sqlite
    select 
        id as id, 
        name as name, 
        (is_big = 'Y') as isBig 
    from custom_company 
    where is_big = 'Y'
    ```
=== "SQL Server"
    ```sqlserver
    select 
        id as id, 
        name as name, 
        cast(case when is_big = 'Y' then 1 else 0 end as bit) as isBig 
    from custom_company 
    where (is_big = 'Y')
    ```

The parameters are: `[]`

The result type is:

```tsx
const selectAllBigCompanies: Promise<{
    id: number;
    name: string;
    isBig: boolean;
}[]>
```
