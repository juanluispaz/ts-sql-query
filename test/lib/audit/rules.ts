    'as-any':
        'A cast to `any` bypasses the public typed API — usually because the query could not be built the supported way. The decision: (1) if the cast is feeding an invalid value to a runtime guard in a test whose assertions are all about the resulting exception, the rule already exempts it — so if it fired, restructure the test so its assertions are ONLY the exception (try/catch + reason, `toThrow`) and the exemption applies; (2) otherwise this is a REWRITE, not a suppression — build the query through the public typed surface (if the API genuinely cannot express it, that is a library gap to report, not a cast to keep). There is no `tests-audit-disable` for the general case.',

        'An `any` type annotation defeats type-checking and usually hides a test that is not realistic. Use the precise type; for a caught error or an intentionally-opaque value use `unknown` (`let thrown: unknown`). This is the type annotation, not the `as any` cast (that is `as-any`).',

Build the query through the public typed API.',

Elsewhere a test has no reason not to be precise: pin the value (`expect(rows.slice().sort()).toEqual([...])`); for SQL use the full `toMatchInlineSnapshot`.',

        '`toBeCloseTo` is an approximate float comparison, warranted only against the real engine (inside a real-DB branch) where floating-point rounding can yield `1.999999…`. Outside a real-DB branch the value comes from the mock (exactly what `mockNext` set) — pin it with `toBe`. If a real float needs approximating, guard the assertion behind `if (ctx.realDbEnabled)`.',
