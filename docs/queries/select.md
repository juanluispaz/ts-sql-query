# Select
 
This page provides an in-depth explanation of how to construct and customize `SELECT` statements using `ts-sql-query`. It covers advanced projection strategies, optional value handling, dynamic ordering, inline subqueries, and compound queries. Each section includes examples, generated SQL, and the resulting TypeScript types to help understand the mapping and behavior.

## Select with joins and order by

```ts
const firstName = 'John';
const lastName = null;

const company = tCompany.as('comp');
const customersWithCompanyName = connection.selectFrom(tCustomer)
    .innerJoin(company).on(tCustomer.companyId.equals(company.id))
    .where(tCustomer.firstName.startsWithInsensitive(firstName))
        .and(tCustomer.lastName.startsWithInsensitiveIfValue(lastName))
    .select({
        id: tCustomer.id,
        firstName: tCustomer.firstName,
        lastName: tCustomer.lastName,
        birthday: tCustomer.birthday,
        companyName: company.name
    })
    .orderBy('firstName', 'insensitive')
    .orderBy('lastName', 'asc insensitive')
    .executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        customer.id as id, 
        customer.first_name as firstName, 
        customer.last_name as lastName, 
        customer.birthday as birthday, 
        comp.name as companyName 
    from customer 
    inner join company as comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where lower(customer.first_name) like concat(lower(?), '%') 
    order by 
        lower(firstName), 
        lower(lastName) asc
    ```
=== "MySQL"
    ```mysql
    select 
        customer.id as id, 
        customer.first_name as firstName, 
        customer.last_name as lastName, 
        customer.birthday as birthday, 
        comp.`name` as companyName 
    from customer 
    inner join company as comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where lower(customer.first_name) like concat(lower(?), '%') 
    order by 
        lower(firstName), 
        lower(lastName) asc
    ```
=== "Oracle"
    ```oracle
    select 
        customer.id as "id", 
        customer.first_name as "firstName", 
        customer.last_name as "lastName", 
        customer.birthday as "birthday", 
        comp.name as "companyName" 
    from customer 
    inner join company comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where lower(customer.first_name) like lower(:0 || '%') escape '\\' 
    order by 
        lower("firstName"), 
        lower("lastName") asc
    ```
===+ "PostgreSQL"
    ```postgresql
    select 
        customer.id as id, 
        customer.first_name as "firstName", 
        customer.last_name as "lastName", 
        customer.birthday as birthday, 
        comp.name as "companyName" 
    from customer 
    inner join company as comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where customer.first_name ilike ($1 || '%') 
    order by 
        lower("firstName"), 
        lower("lastName") asc
    ```
=== "SQLite"
    ```sqlite
    select

        customer.first_name as firstName, 
        customer.last_name as lastName, 
        customer.birthday as birthday, 
        comp.name as companyName 
    from customer 
    inner join company as comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where lower(customer.first_name) like lower(? || '%') escape '\\' 
    order by 
        lower(firstName), 
        lower(lastName) asc
    ```
=== "SQL Server"
    ```sqlserver
    select 
        customer.id as id, 
        customer.first_name as firstName, 
        customer.last_name as lastName, 
        customer.birthday as birthday, 
        comp.name as companyName 
    from customer 
    inner join company as comp on customer.company_id = comp.id 
    where lower(customer.first_name) like lower(@0 + '%') 
    order by 
        lower(firstName), 
        lower(lastName) asc
    ```

The parameters are: `[ 'John' ]`

The result type is:
```tsx
const customersWithCompanyName: Promise<{
    id: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    companyName: string;
    birthday?: Date;
}[]>
```

The name of the columns to order corresponds to the name/path in the query's result. The supported order by modes are:

```ts
type OrderByMode = 'asc' | 'desc' | 'asc nulls first' | 'asc nulls last' | 'desc nulls first' | 'desc nulls last' | 'insensitive' |
 'asc insensitive' | 'desc insensitive' | 'asc nulls first insensitive' | 'asc nulls last insensitive' | 
 'desc nulls first insensitive' | 'desc nulls last insensitive'
```

!!! note

    For the databases that don't support `null first` or `null last`, a proper order by that emulates that behaviour is generated. The `insensitive` modifier makes the ordering key-insensitive according to the [insensitive strategy](../configuration/connection.md#insensitive-strategies) defined in your connection. 
    
    In case the `insensitive` modifier is used in a not string column, the modifier will be just ignored.

!!! tip

    You can project optional values in objects as always-required properties that allow `null` by calling `projectingOptionalValuesAsNullable()` immediately after `select(...)`. This transformation only affects the resulting TypeScript type â€” the generated SQL remains unchanged. Instead of using optional fields (`?`), all properties are treated as required but typed as potentially `null`, which can simplify downstream type checks when dealing with partial or outer-joined data.

## Select ordering by a not returned column

```ts
const customerId = 10;

const customerWithId = connection.selectFrom(tCustomer)
    .where(tCustomer.id.equals(customerId))
    .select({
        id: tCustomer.id,
        firstName: tCustomer.firstName,
        lastName: tCustomer.lastName
    })
    .orderBy(tCustomer.birthday, 'desc nulls last')
    .executeSelectOne();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        id as id, 
        first_name as firstName, 
        last_name as lastName

    customerFirstName: string;
    customerLastName: string;
}[]>
```

## Select with aggregate functions and group by

```ts
const customerCountPerCompany = connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .innerJoin(tCustomer).on(tCustomer.companyId.equals(tCompany.id))
    .groupBy(tCompany.id, tCompany.name)
    .select({
        companyId: tCompany.id,
        companyName: tCompany.name,
        customerCount: connection.count(tCustomer.id)
    })
    .executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        company.id as companyId, 
        company.name as companyName, 
        count(customer.id) as customerCount 
    from company 
    inner join customer on customer.company_id = company.id 
    group by 
        company.id, 
        company.name
    ```

The result type is:
```tsx
const customerCountPerCompany: Promise<{
    companyId: number;
    companyName: string;
    customerCount: number;
}[]>
```

## Select with left join

To use a table or view in a left join, you must create a left join representation first by calling the method `forUseInLeftJoin` or `forUseInLeftJoinAs`.

```ts
const parent = tCompany.forUseInLeftJoinAs('parent');

const leftJoinCompany = connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .leftJoin(parent).on(tCompany.parentId.equals(parent.id))
    .select({
        id: tCompany.id,
        name: tCompany.name,
        parentId: parent.id,
        parentName: parent.name
    }).executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as parentId, 
        parent.name as parentName 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```
=== "MySQL"
    ```mysql
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.`name` as `name`, 
        parent.id as parentId, 
        parent.`name` as parentName 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```
=== "Oracle"
    ```oracle
    select 
        company.id as "id", 
        company.name as "name", 
        parent.id as "parentId", 
        parent.name as "parentName" 
    from company 
    left join company parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```
===+ "PostgreSQL"
    ```postgresql
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as "parentId", 
        parent.name as "parentName" 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```
=== "SQLite"
    ```sqlite
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as parentId, 
        parent.name as parentName 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```
=== "SQL Server"
    ```sqlserver
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as parentId, 
        parent.name as parentName 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```

The parameters are: `[]`

The result type is:
```tsx
const leftJoinCompany: Promise<{
    id: number;
    name: string;
    parentId?: number;
    parentName?: string;
}[]>
```

## Select with left join and complex projections

When you are doing a left join, you probably want to use [Complex projections](complex-projections.md):

```ts
const parent = tCompany.forUseInLeftJoinAs('parent');

const leftJoinCompany = await connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .leftJoin(parent).on(tCompany.parentId.equals(parent.id))
    .select({
        id: tCompany.id,
        name: tCompany.name,
        parent: {
            id: parent.id,
            name: parent.name
        }
    }).executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        company.id as id, 
        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as `parent.id`, 
        parent.name as `parent.name` 
    from company

        parent.`name` as `parent.name` 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```

        company.name as name, 
        parent.id as [parent.id], 
        parent.name as [parent.name] 
    from company 
    left join company as parent on company.parent_id = parent.id
    ```

The parameters are: `[]`

The result type is:
```tsx
const leftJoinCompany: Promise<{
    id: number;
    name: string;
    parent?: {
        id: number;
        name: string;
    };
}[]>
```

## Select with a compound operator (union, intersect, except)

```ts
const allDataWithName = connection.selectFrom(tCustomer)
    .select({
        id: tCustomer.id,
        name: tCustomer.firstName.concat(' ').concat(tCustomer.lastName),
        type: connection.const<'customer' | 'company'>('customer', 'enum', 'customerOrCompany')
    }).unionAll(
        connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
        .select({
            id: tCompany.id,
            name: tCompany.name,
            type: connection.const<'customer' | 'company'>('company', 'enum', 'customerOrCompany')
        })
    ).executeSelectMany();
```

!!! warning

    All combined queries in a compound operator must return the same number of columns with compatible types and matching column names.

!!! note

    Depending on your database, the supported compound operators are: `union`, `unionAll`, `intersect`, `intersectAll`, `except`,  `exceptAll`, `minus` (alias for `except`), `minusAll` (alias for `exceptAll`)

## Using a select as a view in another select query (SQL with clause)

You can define a select query and use it as if it were a view in another select query.

To allow it, you must call the `forUseInQueryAs` method instead of executing the query. This returns a view-like representation that will be included as a `WITH` clause in the final SQL, using the name passed to `forUseInQueryAs`.

```ts
const customerCountPerCompanyWith = connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .innerJoin(tCustomer).on(tCustomer.companyId.equals(tCompany.id))
    .select({
        companyId: tCompany.id,
        companyName: tCompany.name,
        customerCount: connection.count(tCustomer.id)
    }).groupBy('companyId', 'companyName')
    .forUseInQueryAs('customerCountPerCompany');

const customerCountPerAcmeCompanies = connection.selectFrom(customerCountPerCompanyWith)
    .where(customerCountPerCompanyWith.companyName.containsInsensitive('ACME'))
    .select({
        acmeCompanyId: customerCountPerCompanyWith.companyId,
        acmeCompanyName: customerCountPerCompanyWith.companyName,
        acmeCustomerCount: customerCountPerCompanyWith.customerCount
    })
    .executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

## Inline subquery as value

To use a select query that returns one column as an inline query value, you must get the value representation by calling the method `forUseAsInlineQueryValue` and then use the value representation as with any other value in a secondary query.

```ts
const acmeId = connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .where(tCompany.name.equals('ACME'))
    .selectOneColumn(tCompany.id)
    .forUseAsInlineQueryValue();

const acmeCustomers = connection.selectFrom(tCustomer)
    .where(tCustomer.companyId.equals(acmeId))
    .select({
        id: tCustomer.id,
        name: tCustomer.firstName.concat(' ').concat(tCustomer.lastName)
    })
    .executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        id as id, 
        concat(first_name, ?, last_name) as name 
    from customer 
    where company_id = (
        select id as result 
        from company 
        where name = ?
    )
    ```
=== "MySQL"
    ```mysql
    select 
        id as id, 
        concat(first_name, ?, last_name) as `name` 
    from customer 
    where company_id = (
        select id as result 
        from company 
        where `name` = ?
    )
    ```

    where company_id = (
        select id as [result] 
        from company 
        where name = @1
    )
    ```

## Inline subquery referencing outer query

To use a select query that returns one column as an inline query value that references the outer query's tables, you must start the subquery calling `subSelectUsing` and providing by argument the external tables or views required to execute the subquery, and then get the value representation, in the end, by calling the method `forUseAsInlineQueryValue` and then use the value representation as with any other value in the outer query.

```ts
const numberOfCustomers = connection
    .subSelectUsing(tCompany)
    .from(tCustomer)
    .where(tCustomer.companyId.equals(tCompany.id))
    .selectCountAll()
    .forUseAsInlineQueryValue();  // At this point is a value that you can use in other query

const companiesWithNumberOfCustomers = connection.selectFrom(tCompany)
    .select({
        id: tCompany.id,
        name: tCompany.name,
        numberOfCustomers: numberOfCustomers
    })
    .executeSelectMany();
```

The executed query is:

=== "MariaDB"
    ```mariadb
    select 
        id as id, 
        name as name, 
        (
            select count(*) as result

```

!!! tip

    In the previous example, it is more convenient to use `.selectCountAll()` instead of `.selectOneColumn(connection.countAll())` because the returned value will not be optional; if not, you will not need to use `.selectOneColumn(connection.countAll()).valueWhenNull(0)` to achive same optionality result.

## Select clauses order

The order of clauses in a select query must follow one of the supported logical patterns:

!!! warning

    These orders are enforced by the library to ensure SQL correctness across databases. Below is a list of valid clause orders.

- **Logical order**: from, join, **WHERE**, **group by**, **having**, **select**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative logical order 1**: from, join, **group by**, **having**, **WHERE**, **select**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative logical order 2**: from, join, **group by**, **having**, **select**, **WHERE**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative logical order 3**: from, join, **group by**, **having**, **select**, order by, **WHERE**, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative logical order 4**: from, join, **group by**, **having**, **select**, order by, limit, offset, **WHERE**, customizeQuery
- **Alternative logical order 5**: from, join, **group by**, **having**, **select**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery, **WHERE**
  
- **Alternative order 1**: from, join, **select**, **WHERE**, **group by**, **having**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative order 2**: from, join, **select**, **group by**, **having**, **WHERE**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative order 3**: from, join, **select**, **group by**, **having**, order by, **WHERE**, limit, offset, customizeQuery
- **Alternative order 4**: from, join, **select**, **group by**, **having**, order by, limit, offset, **WHERE**, customizeQuery
- **Alternative order 5**: from, join, **select**, **group by**, **having**, order by, limit, offset, customizeQuery, **WHERE**

??? note "Oracle variants"

    [Oracle](../configuration/supported-databases/oracle.md) support _start with_, _connect by_ and _ordering siblings only_. The _ordering siblings only_ modifier changes the previous `order by` to `order siblings by`.
