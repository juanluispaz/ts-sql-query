# NoopQueryRunner

A query runner that simulates a database connection and always returns empty results. Useful for testing or disabling execution without modifying application logic.

!!! success "Supported databases"

    - [MariaDB](../../supported-databases/mariadb.md)
    - [MySQL](../../supported-databases/mysql.md)
    - [Oracle](../../supported-databases/oracle.md)
    - [PostgreSQL](../../supported-databases/postgresql.md)
    - [SQLite](../../supported-databases/sqlite.md)
    - [SQL Server](../../supported-databases/sqlserver.md)

!!! tip

    `NoopQueryRunner` supports synchronous query execution. See the [Synchronous query runners](../../../advanced/synchronous-query-runners.md) for more information.

!!! warning "Do not share connections between requests"

    A `ts-sql-query` connection object — along with the query runner instances passed to its constructor — represents a **dedicated connection** to the database.

    Therefore, **you must not share the same connection object between concurrent HTTP requests**. Instead, create a new connection object for each request, along with its own query runners.

    Even if the query runner internally uses a connection pool, the `ts-sql-query` connection still represents a single active connection, acquired from the pool. It must be treated as such and never reused across requests.

## Usage Example

```ts
import { NoopQueryRunner } from "ts-sql-query/queryRunners/NoopQueryRunner";

async function main() {
    const connection = new DBConnection(new NoopQueryRunner());
    // Queries here will not hit a real database
}
```
